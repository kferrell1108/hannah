Just a quick update on the effort to fund and award the Hannah Taylor Memorial Award for the graduating class of 2020.  As you may recall, earlier this year, Pete Beckary reached out to the Sullivan County High School to determine the status of the Hannah Taylor Memorial Award.  Thanks to that inquiry, he determined that the original funding had been exhaused and the award had been kept alive by the SCHS staff and the Sullivan County Preservation Society.  Pete contacted a great many of us to gauge interest in stepping up to fund this award.

Good news is that we were able to quickly raise $1,150 and award two deserving students, Jessica King ($700) and Samuel Carpenter ($300).  Many of us watched the live stream of the graduating ceremonies, held outdoors due to COVID.  Their winning submissions are attached.  Many of us expressed the desire to continue and improve this award for 2021 and beyond.  The goal is to have the award fully defined and funded by the end of the year, this will provide sufficient time to socialize it with the students and for them to have time to develop an essay.  

We will keep you updated over the next few months about progress on the award for 2021 and beyond.  If you have any stories about Hannah, either first hand or passed down through relatives, we'd be interested in hearing about them. They will guide us in developing essay topics and help us put together a more complete picture of her life.  <attached list info>
